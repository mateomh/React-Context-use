# REACT USECONTEXT HOOK

> This repo is to go deeper into how to use the useContext hook in react.


The objective of this project was to understand and show practical example of the use of useContext hook in React.

## Built With

- Hooks
- React


# How to use it

The use case for this learning investigation is a shopping website that implements a shopping cart functionality that uses the Context API for React

## Setup Locally

To run the application locally you will need to follow several steps to make it work.

First, you have to check if you have **nodejs** installed on your machine. For this type the following command in your terminal:

> node -v

If **command not found** shows as a response, then go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) and follow the instructions to install it. After completing the installation the same command should show you a version number.

Then clone the [repository](https://github.com/mateomh/TasklistTypescript.git) into your local drive and open a terminal in the root folder of the project and install the necessary packages to make it work by running this command:

> npm install

This will get the project ready to run. After this run the following command to start the development server on **localhost:3000/** and wait for the browser to open:

> npm start

If the browser does not open or you close it by accident, but the server is still running you can type **localhost:3000/** in your address bar to get into the application again.
